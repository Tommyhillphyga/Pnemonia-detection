# Pnemonia-detection

This application is a seamless integration of  a CNN Based classifier and a Language model and using Gradio as the user interface. 

It is designed to detect Pneumonia from Chest X-rays and provide a diagnosis on the classified class using a LangChain LLM Framework. 

This model was trained on the pneumonia dataset on Kaggle.
